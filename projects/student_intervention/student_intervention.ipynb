In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "These generated columns are sometimes called _dummy variables_, and we will use the [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) function to perform this transformation. Run the code cell below to perform the preprocessing routine discussed in this section."

The distribution of absences values is positively skewed with a few students missing significantly more than 30 days of school.

You will first discuss the reasoning behind choosing these three models by considering what you know about the data and each model's strengths and weaknesses. You will then fit the model to varying sizes of training data (100 data points, 200 data points, and 300 data points) and measure the F<sub>1</sub> score. You will need to produce three tables (one for each model) that shows the training set size, training time, prediction time, F<sub>1</sub> score on the training set, and F<sub>1</sub> score on the testing set.\n",

    "<div style=\"background-color:powderblue;\">Each of the models above can be used for binary classification. In order to narrow the choices, I began by trying to understand if the problem is or is not linearly seperable. To gain intuition for this, I ran a SVM with a linear RBF kernel. As shown below, when I determine that the prediction accuracy on this data with this model is far from perfect, I conclude that the problem is not linearly separable. Even if there exist some outliers in the data, the classification error is too high to be attributable to these data points. (Sidebar - in order to prove this to myself I created a faux dataset that was definitively linearly seperable and showed myself that the classification error using a linear SVM was indeed 0%.)</div>"

    "**Data Summary Q&amp;A:**  \n",
    "<u>How much data do you have?</u> The dataset contains 395 samples. When using 75% of the data for training our model, this number reduced to approximately 300 training points. I consider this a moderate size dataset (not tiny, but definitely not big).  \n",
    "<u>How many features are there?</u> Originally, we start with 31 features. After preprocessing the data to make categorical variables into numeric features as dummy variables, we have 48 features. This is moderately high dimensionality.  \n",
    "<u>What's the ratio of observations to features?</u> 300 / 48 = 6.25. Using the training set, the ratio of observations to features is 6.25.  \n",
    "<u>Are there outliers that should be removed?</u> As noted above, I will not be removing any data points as outliers for this analysis.  \n",
    "<u>Is the problem linearaly seperable?</u> As noted above, the problem is not linearally separable and will wiegh heavily on algorithm choice.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Model Investigation:**  \n",
    "Below, I explore the advantages and weaknesses of 4 supervised learning models: Decision Tree, Ensemble Methods, KNN, and non-linear SVMs.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<em>Decision Trees</em>  \n",
    "Decision trees have excellent accuracy. In fact, sometimes they fit the training data too well and tend to overfit. This occurs when the dataset is small or large. These models have moderate training times - especially when there are a very large number of features. A unique attribute of decision trees is their ability to provide feature importances to the modeler - this means we can dig in remove features (reduce model complexity) which don't contribute performance improvement. Lastly, decision trees are not effected by outliers (even though I am assuming no outliers) or scale normalization. Decision trees are easy to work with right out of the box and provide good accuracy for problems, such as this one, that are not linearally separable. Easy to interpret output. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<em>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)</em>  \n",
    "KNN works well with large amounts of observations and relatively low number of dimensions aka features and in such circumstances can be very effective. KNN is a instance-based learner which means it holds on to all of the data points in order to make a prediction about future data -- a less than computationally efficient approach (they take up a lot of memory). Easy to interpret output. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<em>(Non-linear) Support Vector Machines (SVM)</em>  \n",
    "I've tried to run non-linear kernel SVM's on high dimensional data... and it took forever. That is absolutely the biggest drawback of this model type. Additionally, the output is difficult to explain (the black box curse). Aside from those drawbacks, SVM's can be highly accurate for problems with many observations and problems, such as this one, that are not linearally separable.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<em>Ensemble Methods</em> \n",
    "Ensemble methods, such as bagging &amp; boosting, build several instances of a model (decision tree, knn, svm, and so on) on random subsets of the data and then aggregate their individual predictions to form a final prediction. A fantastic analogy for ensemble models is that generally, groups of people can make better decisions than any one individual. The major advantages of such models is high accuracy and the ability to avoid overfitting - assuming you are using the right ensemble method to solve the problem at hand (bagging helps when models have high variance and boosting helps when models have high bias). On the other hand, ensemble methods can we computationally expensive compared to standalone models like decision trees. More difficult to explain results than with other models. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based on the model investigation, this report will move forward with 3 models: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and an ensemble classifier. Based on the output of the first two, I will decide which ensemble method is most approproate - one that compensates for high bias (underfitting) or one that compesates for high variance (overfitting).  \n",

    "We've chosen to move forward with the KNeighborsClassifier in order to identify and help students that, based on their demographic metrics such as age, access to internet at home, and parents level of education, are in jeopardy of not graduating. Relative to the medium size dataset we've used to train the model, the model has performed better (in terms of F1-score) than other models we've tested. While it is not the fastest model we have -- in terms of either time to train the model or time make a prediction on a student -- it is also not the slowest and the trade-off for greater accuracy in our predictions is worth extra seconds.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As we collect more student data and attempt to retrain and improve the performance of our model, we need to keep in mind that the KNeighborsClassifier is an instance based learner which means the cost of training a new model will rise and the cost of carrying the model will rise too. Although it is likely that with more data, we'll get more accurate predictions, this classifier will also need to keep data points with it as we use it to make those more accurate predictions.\n",
