In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "Decision trees have excellent accuracy. In fact, sometimes they fit the training data too well and tend to overfit. This occurs when the dataset is small or large. These models have moderate training times - especially when there are a very large number of features. A unique attribute of decision trees is their ability to provide feature importances to the modeler - this means we can dig in remove features (reduce model complexity) which don't contribute performance improvement. Lastly, decision trees are not effected by outliers (even though I am assuming no outliers) or scale normalization. Decision trees are easy to work with right out of the box and provide good accuracy for problems, such as this one, that are not linearally separable. Easy to interpret output. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",

KNN is a instance-based learner which means it holds on to all of the data points in order to make a prediction about future data -- a less than computationally efficient approach (they take up a lot of memory). Easy to interpret output. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",

A fantastic analogy for ensemble models is that generally, groups of people can make better decisions than any one individual. The major advantages of such models is high accuracy and the ability to avoid overfitting - assuming you are using the right ensemble method to solve the problem at hand (bagging helps when models have high variance and boosting helps when models have high bias). On the other hand, ensemble methods can we computationally expensive compared to standalone models like decision trees. More difficult to explain results than with other models. You can also see prediction probabilities.  \n",
